# Njord 2025

The Njord challenge is an international student competition focused on autonomous ships. Students design and build autonomous vessels, then compete in a series of challenges at the Trondheimsfjord in Norway. It aims to promote innovation in maritime autonomy and provide students with practical experience. 

### This years tasks were:

1. *Maneuvering* - Tests the ability to naviagte a strict pathway using waypoints.
2. *Pathfinding* - The vessel must navigate between two waypoints, avoiding obstacles along the way with it's pathfinding tech.
3. *Collision avoidance* - The vessel must be able to adapt to dynamic obstables, such as other moving vessels.
4. *Docking* - The vessel must safely and briefly dock before continuing its path. 

### Challenges with SV3 Design Due to Requirements

+ One of the requirements was that each vessel had to navigate using it's GPS position
  - This was a challenge as ....
